// MANY THANKS GOES TO 'CODE WITH ANIA KUBOW'

// FOR LAYING THE FOUNDATION AND INSPIRING ME TO COMPLETE
// THIS PROJECT
//
// AND THE DRAG-DROP-SIMULATOR GUY
// https://ghostinspector.com/blog/simulate-drag-and-drop-javascript-casperjs/
//
// BELOW IS WHAT I'VE DONE TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT
//
// ALL FUNNY JUMPING MOVES ARE FIXED -- (new coordinate system is responsible for this)
// EVERY LEGAL MOVE VALIDATED -- (enpassent, castling rights, no castling through check, queening etc.)
// CHECK DETECTION AND VALIDATION -- (not only is check detected, but one may not PUT oneself in check)
//
// I accomplished this by adding a 'range' for each color
// in each 'range' array is every coordinate that every piece of that color observes
// if the king's coordinate square is in the opponents range, then we have check

// What I wish I had accomplished:
// : Mate detection
// : Queening piece selection
// : Move log with buttons to replay through the moves
